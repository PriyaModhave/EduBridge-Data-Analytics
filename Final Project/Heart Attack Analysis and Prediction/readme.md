## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Predict the Heart Attack based on the features provided.

## DATA DICTIONARY
Age : Age of the patient

Sex : Sex of the patient

exng: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

caa: number of major vessels (0-3)

cp : Chest Pain type chest pain type

    Value 0: typical angina
    Value 1: atypical angina
    Value 2: non-anginal pain
    Value 3: asymptomatic
trtbps : resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)

oldpeak : ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

chol : cholestoral in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor

fbs : (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)

restecg : resting electrocardiographic results

    Value 0: normal
    Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
    Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
thalachh : maximum heart rate achieved

slp:slope

8.CONCLUSION

# APPROACH:
THE AIM TO CREATE ODEL THAT HELP THE USER TO APPLY MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH TO PREDICT THE SATISFICATION LEVEL.HERE,THE MODEL USED ARE

1.SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE

2.LOGISTIC REGRESSION

3.GAUSSIAN NAIVE BAYES

4.NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFIER FOR MULTIVARIATE BERNOULLI MODELS

5.RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER

6.KNEIGHBORS CLASSIFIER

7.GRADIENT BOOSTING FOR CLASSIFICATION

## CONCLUSION:
In general, the models have good predictive values. The best guess among them is the BernoulliNB model, as it seems.
