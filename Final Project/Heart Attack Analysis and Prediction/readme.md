## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Predict the Heart Attack based on the features provided.

## DATA DICTIONARY
Age : Age of the patient

Sex : Sex of the patient

exng: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

caa: number of major vessels (0-3)

cp : Chest Pain type chest pain type

    Value 1: typical angina
    Value 2: atypical angina
    Value 3: non-anginal pain
    Value 4: asymptomatic
trtbps : resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)

oldpeak : ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

chol : cholestoral in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor

fbs : (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)

restecg : resting electrocardiographic results

    Value 0: normal
    Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
    Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
thalachh : maximum heart rate achieved

slp:slope
